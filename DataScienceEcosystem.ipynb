It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.\r\n\r\n2. **Pandas**: Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It offers data structures like DataFrames, which are useful for cleaning, transforming, and analyzing structured data.\r\n\r\n3. **Matplotlib**: Matplotlib is a 2D plotting library for Python. It allows Data Scientists to create a wide variety of static, animated, and interactive plots and visualizations.\r\n\r\n4. **scikit-learn**: scikit-learn is a machine learning library in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis and is widely used for tasks such as classification, regression, clustering, and more.\r\n\r\n5. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It is widely used for deep learning applications and provides a comprehensive set of tools for building and deploying machine learning models.\r\n",
